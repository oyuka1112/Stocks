It essentially combines all of the low-level PyCaret code found in the `models_` package to train and save models into the models folder of our repository. Once models have been saved once, however, we don't have to rerun this function; we can just load them in with the `load_models` function below.\n",

If you *really* want to, you can set this to True, but it's honestly just a waste of time to retrain hundreds of models.**\n",
